# Prefix Hash Tree

A TypeScript implementation of two compact Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs):

* smt.ts contains a regular compact SMT.
* sumtree.ts contains a sum tree as a compact SMT where every leaf has an associated non-negative numeric value and every parent node contains the sum of its child nodes' numeric values.
